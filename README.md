you know what to do with this one

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import iostream as std

def main(argc, argv) -> int:
    std.cout << "Hello World!" << std.endl
    return 0
```

there is a `cout` for stdout, `cerr` for stderr, `endl` to insert line feed and flush the buffer and `flush` just to flush the buffer
